                    <p>I'm an AI developer and theoretical linguist.</p>

<p>As an independent software developer, I develop AI products with a heavy focus on on-device AI applications. I'm enthusiastic about on-device AI development, for the benefits of true privacy and eliminated environmental impact, problems that all of the major AI products face which continue to worsen. My latest product <a href="https://twylite.web.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twylite</a> was built on this philosophy to provide a new, completely private AI interface for Mac computers, which I am actively developing.</p>

                    <p>As an academic researcher, I'm interested in language meaning, structure and use in context and how all of these are connected. I have a particular interest in topics of modal semantics, negation, quantification, scope ambiguity. As well as context and language use.
I'm also interested in human cognition generally, including human reasoning and how this relates to artificial systems. My academic publications can be viewed <a href="research.html">here</a>.</p>


<p>I write regularly on my substack <a href="https://paulcrowley7.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soggy Computers</a> on various topics relating to human and artificial intelligence.</p>
